<!-- <p>This map is generated from a Jupyter Notebook file in <a href="https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_talks/talkmap.ipynb">/_talks/talkmap.ipynb</a>, which mines the location fields in the .md files in _talks/.</p> -->
<p>Here is a map showing the places where I've given a talk/poster.  Zoom in or click on a cluster to individual places, and mouse over a place to see details.</p>
