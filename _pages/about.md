I am a phonologist in the [Linguistics Department](http://linguistics.utah.edu) at the [University of Utah](http://utah.edu).  I specialize in theoretical phonology, particularly optionality and prominence-driven phenomena.  I work primarily in Optimality Theory and related frameworks.

My University of Utah faculty profile is [here](https://faculty.utah.edu/~akaplan).
